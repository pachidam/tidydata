## Class Project for "Getting and Cleaning Data"


**Here are the steps that must be performed before running the R script:**

1. Download the zip file from [this URL](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).
2. Unzip the file in the your working directory
3. set your working directory first statement in ([run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R))

**Once those steps are complete, you can run the R script ([run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R)).
** Note that it requires the [reshape2 package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reshape2/index.html), which can be downloaded from CRAN.

**The output of the R script is a tidy.ds data set, [tidy.txt](tidy.txt).**

You can read more about the data and the analysis in the [code book](CodeBook.md).
